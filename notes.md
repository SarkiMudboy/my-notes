  > Go is a high-level general purpose programming language that is statically typed and compiled. It is known for the simplicity of its syntax and the efficiency of development that it enables by the inclusion of a large standard library supplying many needs for common projects.[12] It was designed at Google[13] in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson, and publicly announced in November of 2009.[4] It is syntactically similar to C, but also has garbage collection, structural typing,[7] and CSP-style concurrency.[14] It is often referred to as Golang to avoid ambiguity and because of its former domain name, golang.org, but its proper name is Go.[15]

  > here are two major implementations:

The original, self-hosting[16] compiler toolchain, initially developed inside Google;[17]
A frontend written in C++, called gofrontend,[18] originally a GCC frontend, providing gccgo, a GCC-based Go compiler;[19] later extended to also support LLVM, providing an LLVM-based Go compiler called gollvm.[20]
A third-party source-to-source compiler, GopherJS,[21] transpiles Go to JavaScript for front-end web development.
